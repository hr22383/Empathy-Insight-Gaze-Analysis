The study's thorough methodology, findings, discussion, conclusions, and recommendations are all included in this repository. The study focuses on using eye tracker technology to evaluate candidates for jobs for their ability to demonstrate empathy. The introduction gives a general overview of the importance of empathy in the workplace and how it affects effective communication, interpersonal relationships, and conflict resolution. It emphasizes how empathy improves collaboration, efficiency, and inclusiveness and how this leads to the hiring of sympathetic job applicants. The use of novel technologies, including eye tracker technology, is considered for evaluating empathy.

The organized method used to analyses the dataset of empathy ratings is described in the section Methodologies. It discusses the steps involved in preparing data, such as converting non-numeric columns, maintaining data continuity, and computing core trends. The creation of a predictive model utilizing GroupKFold cross-validation and the RandomForestRegressor algorithm is described in detail, as well as the integration of pertinent columns for analysis. The metrics for model evaluation are shown, and the information is arranged in a participant-centered data frame. The distribution of several variables for the test group is shown using a comparative histogram analysis in the presentation. This research sheds light on the model's consistency and predictive power for the test group. A comparison histogram analysis is carried out for the control group, much like in the preceding section. This analysis makes a comparison easier.

A thorough comparison between the predictive abilities of Dataset II (Control group) and Dataset III (Test group) is presented in the section Main findings and Discussion. The model's correctness and consistency are assessed using important metrics including Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). On prediction outcomes, it is discussed how modifications made in the test group had a good effect. To help readers visualize the model's performance, empathy scores for participants in the control group and test group are represented visually. The ramifications and restrictions of the study's findings are thoroughly discussed. It emphasizes the significance of dataset extension to increase the generalizability of the model, as well as the potential advantages of including other data sources and objective evaluation systems. 

The study's findings highlight the potential of eye tracker data for empathic evaluation in HR hiring procedures. To ensure openness and ethical use of the model's outputs, recommendations include dataset growth, expert collaboration, and the implementation of explainable AI approaches. The examination of candidate backgrounds' effects on empathy scores as well as the incorporation of other data sources for improved empathy assessment accuracy are some potential directions for future research.
