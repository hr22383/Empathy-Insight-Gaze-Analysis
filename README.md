"Empathy Assessment Using Eye Tracker Data for HR Recruitment Processes." 

This repository contains the detailed methodology, findings, discussion, conclusions, and recommendations of the study. The research focuses on the application of eye tracker technology to assess empathy in potential job candidates during the recruitment process. The introduction provides an overview of empathy's significance in the workplace and its impact on positive interpersonal relationships, communication, and conflict resolution. It highlights the role of empathy in enhancing teamwork, productivity, and inclusivity, leading to the recruitment of empathetic candidates. The adoption of innovative technologies, such as eye tracker technology, for empathy assessment is discussed.

The section Methodologies the structured approach used to analyze the empathy scores dataset. It explains the data preprocessing steps, including the conversion of non-numeric columns, data continuity maintenance, and computation of central tendencies. The integration of relevant columns for analysis is detailed, along with the establishment of a predictive model using GroupKFold cross-validation and the RandomForestRegressor algorithm. Model evaluation metrics are presented, and the results are organized in a participant-centric data frame. A comparative histogram analysis is presented, showcasing the distribution of multiple variables for the test group. This analysis provides insights into the predictive accuracy and consistency of the model for the test group. Similar to the previous section, a comparative histogram analysis is conducted for the control group. This analysis facilitates a comparison of the model's performance between the control and test groups.

The section Main findings and Discussion presents a comprehensive comparison between the predictive performance of Dataset II (Control group) and Dataset III (Test group). Key metrics, such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE), are used to evaluate the model's accuracy and consistency. The positive impact of changes made in the test group on prediction results is discussed. Visual representations of empathy scores for participants in the control group and test group are provided, enabling readers to visualize the model's performance. The discussion delves into the implications and limitations of the study's outcomes. It highlights the importance of dataset expansion to enhance the model's generalizability, as well as the potential benefits of incorporating supplementary data sources and objective assessment mechanisms. Strategies for improving the model's effectiveness and alignment with practical HR requisites are proposed.

The study's conclusions emphasize the potential of eye tracker data for empathetic assessment in HR recruitment processes. Recommendations include dataset expansion, collaboration with experts, and the adoption of explainable AI methodologies to ensure transparency and ethical utilization of the model's outcomes. Possible future research directions are outlined, including the integration of additional data sources for enhanced empathy assessment accuracy and the exploration of candidate backgrounds' impact on empathy scores. A list of references cited throughout the paper is provided, allowing readers to access the sources that informed the research.
